### Changelog:-

* v1.1:
	Additions/Features:-
		[+] Official BFAC User-Agent - Thanks Christian Folini (@ChrFolini)
		[+] Additional BFA patterns.
		[+] Better way of parsing URLs - Thanks Omar Kurt (@omarkurt) 
		[+] --dvcs-test flag to only check for exposed DVCS repositories, (DVCS tests are done by default when using BFAC on level 4, now you can run it seperately).
		[+] --api flag to return findings in JSON form.
		[+] --timeout option to control the timeout.
		[+] --proxy flag to issue requests via proxies when testing.
		[+] --proxy-cred to be used with --proxy flag for handling proxy credintials.
		[+] --user-agent, -ua to specify your own user-agent, (--random-agent is available since v1.0).
		[+] --cookie flag to specify arbitray HTTP Cookie header.
		[+] --host flag to specify arbitray HTTP Host header.
		[+] --headers flag to add arbitrary HTTP headers in requests.
		[+] --invalid-content-length flag:
				When verifying the existence of files, BFAC by default send an initial request to determine the content-length
				and to build an idea about the invalid (not found) pages. This flag can be used to disable the automatic process
				of sending an initial request and manually specifying a content-length of an invalid page. It's an optional flag
				that can be used when facing false-positives, tests shows it rarely need this option, but it would be good to have
				it since BFAC aims to be an "All-in-One" tool for testing backup-file artifacts.
		[+] --content-length-range flag:
				This option can be used to optmise the range of the invalid pages based on the content-length.
				It's an optional flag, and the reason this flag is added is as same as --invalid-content-length flag.
		[+] New --help design.
